# Data mining lecture exercises
My solutions to the exercises from [here](http://las.ethz.ch/courses/datamining-f15/).

Note: Data should not be checked into repo due to ETH copyright.
Unzip the data folder downloaded from the course web site into the individual exercise folders, e.g. `ex1/hw1-data/`.
